        <h3>My journey in short</h3>
        <p> Hi, I'm Chiara Enters and here you can get to know me just a bit better.</p>
        <p> I'm a young 21-year old student currently in her first year of the study Communication and Multimedia Design. 
          Before this study I already did one year of Art school and one year of univercity. 
          Between these two study years I decided to take a gap-year, as I believed it was time to take a step back and catch a breath of fresh air (and insight).
        </p>
        <p> My love for nature started as a fascination with the ability to freeze a moment in time that might never be the same again.
          On days that life gets a bit tough or my head and heart are heavy, I always go sit outsite wherever I am.
          Or atleast try n get a glimps of the sky outside. Even on rainy gray days the fog and raindrops on a glas window or plant, are as much comforting as the sunny days. 
          In fact, It makes me appreciate the sunny days and wonders even more. Because where ever I might be I'm still an island girl who prefers blue skies and seas.
        </p> 
        <p> I am a bit of a perfectionist which gives me a weak spot for details and quality. I <em>strongly</em> believe that no matter the situation one should always go for quality in their work.
          Yes, this might take a bit more effort and time but the results always pay off when people acknowledge the hardwork and effort. 
          Also, you can bet that they will come back for more collaborations, wink wink.
        </p>
        <p> All in all, I'm still a simple student who is eager to grow and learn more skills and also trying to enjoy life.
